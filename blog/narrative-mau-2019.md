### Meet up with us at the MGM Grand to learn how Narrative can impact your mobile growth objectives

Narrative will be attending MAU 2019, our first time ever, and we’re excited to hear from all of the thought leaders that will be present.

Narrative’s platform centralizes and simplifies the data transaction ecosystem and automates data acquisition and distribution efforts. Industry-leading DTCs, QSRs, and tech companies leverage our technology to:

* Fuel data strategies
* Build data monetization businesses
* Enrich first party data
* Create a 360 view of customers with ID Mapping and Attribution

Since our inception we’ve built solutions to help growth marketers achieve their goals and we’d love to find time to meet with folks on the ground to discuss their pain points and brainstorm on possible solutions.

MAU is a one-of-a-kind conference where the best minds in mobile dive deep into growth and retention strategies, marketing, best practices, and industry insights. This year, on May 1st and 2nd, over 2200 marketing professionals will descend on the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. We hope to see you there!
