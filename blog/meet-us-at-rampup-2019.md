### Let our data acquisition and data monetization experts help you reevaluate your data strategy

On February 25th nearly 2500 data professionals will descend on the Fairmont in San Francisco for LiveRamp’s annual RampUp conference. RampUp has long been the premier data + marketing conference and this year is shaping up to be an interesting one.
  
Narrative will be there to meet with current customers and to give platform overviews to companies looking to modernize their data strategy.  
  
If you fall into one of the following categories we should setup some time to talk:

* Growth marketers who are trying to get data provides true ROI
* Brand marketers who need to empower their marketing science teams
* Data scientists looking to get access to raw data to feed your models
* Executives in charge of data monetization strategies
* Folks who understand how important a cogent data strategy is, but are frustrated by how hard it can be to execute on.

If you fall into one of those categories or if there are some that you think we missed schedule some time with the Narrative team by clicking [here](/contact).
