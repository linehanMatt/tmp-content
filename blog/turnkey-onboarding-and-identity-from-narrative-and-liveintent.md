### Choice, speed and control. In a changing ecosystem, organizations reliant on data can't afford less

The market is hungry for data, but everywhere you look there are potential roadblocks and radical change across the entire ecosystem. GDPR, CCPA, Apple ITP, Google ITP, etc, plus the list of incumbent aging [identity solutions](/blog/identity-resolution) with less transparency & inability to assess data quality of providers are making it hard for businesses to efficiently create a successful data strategy.

#### What this means for your brand, the TL;DR

Harness better accuracy from sources that understand their linkages in a first party context and build data assets that allow your brand to enable the same capabilities as the walled gardens.

Let data flow to your brand, not away from it as had been the industry shortcoming.

Accelerate the speed with which you can activate your data in a controlled environment and engage with partners and the ecosystem.

The LiveIntent platform business, made up of over 2,500 brand and publisher clients and reaching 250 million verified people monthly, constitutes one of the world’s largest identity graphs.

LiveIntent’s onboarding service, which launched April 1, is a natural outgrowth of its platform business but is a separate entity. The onboarding service does not use the data from the platform to perform its services unless clients have chosen to engage in and benefit from onboarding themselves.

#### Where Narrative’s software comes into play

Narrative offers a white label experience, turnkey connectivity, and an easy-to-use interface for LiveIntent’s partners. Narrative also acts as a neutral party in powering the distribution of the onboarding service.

Narrative takes a traditionally complex process and makes it point-and-click. The result is a new option that is faster and provides more control. It also levels the playing field for publishers and brands while weaning the industry off of the one-size-fits-all solutions from the entrenched, dominant players in the space.

“At Narrative, our mission has always been to help companies operationalize their data strategies as efficiently as possible, without giving up strategic control,” said Founder and CEO of Narrative Nick Jordan. “Few companies, if any, have LiveIntent’s ability to deliver an onboarding service of this magnitude. Their entry into onboarding immediately changes the market. Narrative will manage the data processing & permissioning and navigate a complex network of delivery endpoints so that LiveIntent can maximize its customers’ opportunities to leverage data for new forms of value creation. This partnership enables LiveIntent and its customers to move with speed.”

“The partnership of Narrative and LiveIntent represents the union of capabilities tailored for a digital ecosystem at a moment of change,” said LiveIntent Founder and CEO Matt Keiser. “Publishers and brands are at a crucial point in history as they grapple with both increasing market dominance by a handful of digital players and the related necessity for companies to maximize their use of their first-party data. This gets more important as third-party identifiers lose relevance.”
