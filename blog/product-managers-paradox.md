In an age where data has become essential for decision-making, product managers find themselves in a complex juggling act. The role has evolved to encompass many responsibilities that increasingly rely on data analytics. However, the task of managing, processing, and utilizing data effectively presents its own set of challenges. Today we explore the realities faced by product managers in working with data and propose strategies to alleviate the pressures of this multifaceted role.

#### Demanding Data Scientists

Among the myriad of responsibilities, one of the critical aspects that a product manager grapples with is the insatiable hunger of data scientists for more and better data. Data scientists are in a constant quest for comprehensive datasets to develop robust models. While their intent is to push the envelope, the frequent need for more data can sometimes frustrate the product managers who must balance these demands within the constraints of available resources.

#### Reluctant Engineers

On the other side of the spectrum, engineers are often not keen on handling ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs, which are critical for data preparation and integration. ETL processes, integral to data pipelines, are often viewed as complex and monotonous. The reluctance of engineers to work on these critical aspects is partly due to the nature of the tasks – they are often tedious, and a source of endless maintenance issues. This leaves product managers in a tricky situation, pressured to deliver high-quality data but constrained by limited enthusiasm and resources.

#### Marketing's Data Dilemma

Marketing teams are not to be left behind in this complex dance. The term ‘data-driven marketing’ has become prevalent. However, there is often a disconnect between the use of the word 'data' and understanding what it entails. Marketing teams might pressure product managers for data without comprehending the complexity involved in extracting meaningful insights, adding another layer of pressure to the product manager's role.

#### A Unified Data Collaboration Platform

#### A Beacon of Hope?

One of the potential solutions for product managers could be an integrated data collaboration platform (DCP). Such a platform can streamline data pipelines and provide a single source of truth. A well-integrated DCP not only enables seamless collaboration and sharing but can also [automate the ETL processes](/products/rosetta-stone). This means engineers can focus on more value-driven tasks, leaving the monotonous aspects to automation.

Furthermore, through DCP, data scientists are empowered with tools that allow them to independently access and manipulate data. They can also explore external data partnerships, which can sometimes satiate their need for more data. This means they would not have to rely on product managers for every dataset, and the product manager can have more time to focus on other pressing issues.

In addition, marketing teams can utilize DCP to access relevant data without overburdening the product managers. By being able to interact with data directly, marketing teams might develop a better understanding of data constraints and possibilities, thus aligning their expectations with reality.

#### Training and Education

While a data collaboration platform can be a vital tool, it is also essential to ensure that all stakeholders have a common understanding of data. Regular training and education sessions for data scientists, engineers, and marketing teams about the potential, limitations, and the right usage of data can lead to more realistic expectations and harmonious collaboration.

#### The Human Touch

It’s also important to remember that while data is crucial, human insights and experience are equally important. Encouraging a culture that values human judgment and intuition can sometimes provide perspectives that data alone cannot reveal.

#### Finding the Balance

The modern product manager’s role is a delicate dance with data. With expectations coming from all directions, including data scientists, engineers, and marketing teams, it can be a daunting task. However, by employing a data collaboration platform, coupled with training, education, and valuing human insights, product managers can find the balance needed to effectively manage the challenges of this evolving role. The path is not easy, but with the right tools and strategies, product managers are poised to transform challenges into opportunities.
