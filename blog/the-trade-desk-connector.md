Quickly and easily onboard and deliver audiences to The Trade Desk for advertiser activation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Trade Desk is the world’s largest independent demand-side platform. Advertisers use The Trade Desk’s platform to run targeted, data-driven digital advertising campaigns across media channels. Data providers can supply additional information and insights to advertisers using The Trade Desk to enable them to fine-tune their targeting of potential customers.

As brands continue to put more of their advertising budgets into programmatic advertising, demand for valuable and unique audience insights grows stronger. In the past, however, organizations who wanted to capitalize on this growing demand for their customer data had to invest in expensive infrastructure or hire teams of data engineers and developers to transform their raw first-party data into addressable audience segments and deliver it to advertisers for activation.

Narrative simplifies and streamlines the entire process. With Narrative’s data collaboration platform and our new The Trade Desk Connector, organizations can slice and dice their first-party data into audience segments and deliver them directly to advertisers on The Trade Desk or make them available for purchase in The Trade Desk’s marketplace. By using this integration, you’ll cut out unnecessary and expensive extra steps, saving time and resources while your data generates a new stream of revenue.

Furthermore, with the partnership between Narrative and The Trade Desk, matching your audience to UID2 identifiers and delivering your data to advertisers is now easier, faster, and more cost-effective than ever. The Trade Desk connector will enable data providers to sidestep pricey intermediaries and match audience segments automatically before delivery. Just use Narrative’s no-code tools to create custom audience segments for your buyers and our integration will automatically take care of matching your first-party data to UID2 identifiers before directly delivering your appended data to your buyers at The Trade Desk.

#### 4\. Review and activate your audience segment

Once you’ve completed all of these steps and clicked “Activate,” your data will automatically be matched to UID2 identifiers and delivered to The Trade Desk in 15 minutes or less.
