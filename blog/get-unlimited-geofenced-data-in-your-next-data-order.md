Buyers can now specify geofenced areas as a requirement for their data purchases through Buyer Studio
======================================================================================================

Instead of being limited to international, federal, and local boundaries such as specific states or countries, you'll now be able to determine the geographic regions that best serve your use case by using points, line-strings, polygons, multipolygons, and multi line-strings to create geofences. There is no limit to the number of geofences you can include in your data order! In fact, users are encouraged to forecast with different geofence quantities until the number of events meets their requirements.  

Geofenced data can be used by buyers for a multitude of use cases. For instance, buyers can provide a geofenced region to understand a new market that they are considering entering. Buyers could also provide a list of geofences around the brick and mortar locations of their competitors to target their competition’s customer base. It's also possible to provide a list of geofences around construction projects to understand degrees of fallout if something were to go wrong. These are just a few examples of the many ways geofencing can help you plan, predict, improve, and succeed.

Here’s how to use it
=====================

1) Upload a list of your locations into Dataset Manager using CSV, JSON, or Parquet.

2) Launch Buyer Studio and select the Geographic POI Attribute (specifically the POI property under the attribute).

3) Select other attributes that represent the information you are looking for within each location.

4) Filter using the "Join Dataset" button and select the dataset with your list of locations.
