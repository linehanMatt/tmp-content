As we venture into 2024, the digital marketing landscape continues to evolve. The long-promised [demise of third-party cookies](https://www.adexchanger.com/privacy/google-plans-to-ring-in-the-new-year-with-third-party-cookie-deprecation-for-real/) is becoming a reality with Google’s latest Chrome feature release set for January 4th. At the same time, the regulatory environment around privacy and user consent will continue to heat up with 12 states (and counting) that have already [passed legislation](https://pro.bloomberglaw.com/brief/state-privacy-legislation-tracker/). Whether you’re a marketer or a digital publisher, an effective audience strategy in 2024 needs to incorporate the following:  

### Develop your Identity Mapping Plan  

Are you leveraging a vendor or building it yourself, incorporating your own rules and heuristics?  How will this integrate with the rest of your tech stack and into various activation platforms?

### Leverage Multiple Sources of Data Supply  

Very few marketers and publishers can just rely on their 1st party data alone.  Putting all your data eggs in one basket is risky in a landscape devoid of third-party cookies. Diversification is key. Organizations need to harness a variety of data sources beyond their own limited 1st party footprints.

### Account For Scalability and Flexibility  

Scalability is another cornerstone of effective identity mapping. As your organization grows, so too should your ability to handle an increasing volume and complexity of data.

### Look to a mix of Deterministic, Contextual, and Probabilistic Data  

There is no silver bullet in the post-cookie world.  An effective identity mapping strategy should balance deterministic, contextual, and probabilistic data. Deterministic data offers certainty but is limited in scope. Contextual data provides insights into user behaviors and environments, and probabilistic data, though less precise, helps identify broader trends. Blending these data types is key to creating a nuanced understanding of your audience.

### Ensure Compliance and Protection of PII  

In this new era, protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and adherence to privacy standards is non-negotiable. Any identity mapping strategy must include robust measures for data security and privacy. This includes compliance with data protection regulations, data encryption, and strict access controls.

### Select the Right Data Suppliers  

Without third-party cookies, the importance of choosing the right data suppliers cannot be overstated. Beyond price, your list of criteria should include quality, compliance, and interoperability with your tech stack and systems. Like any supply chain, you should be careful not to be over-reliant on just one source.

### Executing Your Identity Strategy With Narrative
