### Buyer Studio makes it easy to find and buy precise datasets by automating the most time- and labor-intensive aspects of buying data

Data is the foundation of all modern enterprises' decision-making, innovation, and growth. The most successful organizations augment their first-party data with valuable external sources to uncover new insights and gain a competitive advantage.

However, sourcing external data has typically been cumbersome, time-intensive, and highly inefficient. Existing solutions alleviate some of these inefficiencies but do so at the expense of transparency and control over the process, leading to lots of duplicate and unusable data and wasted time and money.

Data buyers need a tool that automates the most time- and labor-intensive parts of the data buying process while giving them precision and control over what they buy.

That’s why we built **Buyer Studio**, a self-service, no-code app that enables users of any skill level to find the precise data they need, place a custom order, and deliver their data directly to the systems they want, all with just a few clicks.

With Buyer Studio, anyone can filter through trillions of rows of data from over 50 suppliers worldwide to create and buy custom datasets that meet their specific needs and priorities.

Fast and easy
-------------

Buyer Studio was built to make it easy for users of any technical skill level to navigate the data-buying process without knowing any code. No longer does buying data require taking valuable time from your engineering team.

The intuitive workflow and non-technical language mean anyone can create a custom data order, even your intern that started last week. The entire process also takes mere minutes to complete; you can create and purchase your data order before your morning coffee is finished brewing.

And once you place an order, you don’t have to wait days or weeks to receive the data. Just place your order, and it will be delivered to your preferred endpoint by tomorrow morning.

All the data you want
---------------------

With Buyer Studio, you have access to trillions of data points from multiple data providers at once. You’ll be able to select the exact types of data that you’d like to acquire, including but not limited to geolocation, demographic, purchase, identity, and device data.

Buyers can choose to receive data from every data supplier or only one data supplier or choose their favorites. Concerned you might accidentally purchase the same data from different suppliers? Narrative has your back. You can opt into our deduplication feature to ensure you never pay for the same data point more than once.

Only the data you need
----------------------

Buyer Studio’s precision filtering options enable users to include only the exact observations they need and exclude any that they don’t. You can be as meticulous with your data order as you’d like. You could, for instance, choose to purchase only 2,000 rows of data, but the exact 2,000 rows of data you need are based on your precise specifications.

Buyer Studio also ensures that buyers have complete control over how much they spend. With custom budget controls, buyers will never be charged more than the budget they set.

No black boxes
--------------

Guaranteed visibility into all suppliers and data points licensed ensures that you know you are receiving quality sourced data. You'll always know what data you’re buying, who you’re buying it from, and how much it will cost.

How It Works
============

### 1\. Start a data subscription or buy on demand

There are three ways to buy data. You can select a subscription from a pre-made Narrative preset, start a subscription from scratch, or buy data on demand.

Narrative presets are expert-built bundles with predetermined schemas created to include the most in-demand schemas on the platform. Select “Narrative Schema Presets” from the left-side menu and find the preset you want to subscribe to.

Custom subscriptions: You can also create a custom data subscription by selecting specific attributes. To build your custom data stream from scratch, click “New Subscription,” and you’ll be taken to a list of attributes you can choose from. Select the attributes you want and leave the attributes you don’t want to be unselected.

On-demand: If you need data fast but don't want to commit to a yearly contract up-front, you might prefer to buy data on demand. This is a more flexible pricing option that is based on data usage. You can access Narrative's data marketplace anytime, find your desired data, and buy it for one set price. This option is best if you only need data for a one-off project or to test one specific hypothesis without signing up for long-term data acquisition.

### 2\. Apply custom filters & choose your providers

Customize each order using Buyer Studio’s precision filters to limit your data. Only want data that covers women aged 25-34 in Argentina? No problem! You can adjust each data stream with the exact specifications you need. You can also choose to collect every data point available by simply leaving each attribute filter in its default configuration.

Once you’ve customized your selected data streams, you’ll be given the option to buy from all providers or to make specific exclusions and inclusions. Specify which providers you would like to exclude or include in your subscription or simply choose to subscribe to all.

### 3\. Set your destination & budget

Choose where you would like your data to be delivered from a list of our available integrations. You can also choose to have your data delivered to each different endpoint available. Once you’ve selected (s), you’ll be prompted to set your monthly spending limit. You can choose from our most popular budget options or enter a custom budget.

### 4\. Complete your purchase

Once you’ve created your custom data order, you are just a few clicks away from receiving your data delivery. Simply enter your payment information, add a name and description to easily identify your subscription, review your order, and click “Activate Subscription.” Your data order will be delivered to your chosen destination in hours.

### 5\. Manage everything in one place

You’ll be able to see your transaction history, manage existing subscriptions, and connect with other platforms for direct data delivery, all within the app.
