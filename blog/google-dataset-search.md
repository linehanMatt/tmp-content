[Google recently announced an update](https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/02/datasets-at-your-fingertips-in-google.html) that makes it easier for users to find relevant data via search. This is a significant development for data providers, as it provides a great opportunity to get their data in front of new, high-intent customers who are looking for the data they have.

## What are the new updates?

The update announced by Google makes it easier for users to find datasets directly on the search results page. Now, when users search for datasets on Google, theyâ€™ll see a dedicated section that highlights relevant datasets directly on the search results page.

Previously, users had to use a separate site called Dataset Search to access datasets. This meant that datasets were not as easily discoverable as other information on the internet. However, with the new update, datasets are now given the same prominence as other types of information, like products, videos, and websites.

## How can data providers benefit from the update?

This update makes it easier for researchers, analysts, and anyone who needs data to find and access relevant datasets quickly and easily. This also makes it a fantastic opportunity for data providers to get their data in front of new, high-intent customers who are looking for the data they have.

For data providers to take advantage of this feature, their datasets must be optimized for search engines. Specifically, each dataset must be published on a page that contains [schema.org structured metadata](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/dataset) and displays key elements such as description, license, and temporal and spatial coverage.

This is where Data Shops comes in.

## How can Narrative help?

[Data Shops](/solutions/data-monetization) is perfectly suited to help data providers take advantage of this new feature and reach new customers on Google. Here are three reasons why:

### Automated metadata and technical SEO

Data Shops automatically includes relevant metadata and other technical elements to optimize your dataset pages for search engines. This means that you can be confident that your data is structured correctly and will be discoverable on Google's search results page.

### No engineering required

With Data Shops, business users can manage the entire process without relying on technical teams. You can upload and combine data sources, slice and dice your data to create new datasets, and publish them in a custom-branded web store without a single line of code. You could get your datasets up and published in just an afternoon or two.

### Set it and forget it

Once your datasets are live, ongoing maintenance is minimal. Your Data Shop is self-serve, so customers can browse, purchase, and receive your datasets without you having to lift a finger. This means that you can generate passive income from the data you already collect.
