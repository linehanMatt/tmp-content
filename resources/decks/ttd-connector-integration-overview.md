    ## Q&A

    In order to get started, we'll need to know a few things about your data and your audiences:

    - Approximately how many audiences do you have / plan to build?
    - What types of identifiers do you use? (MAIDs, Hashed Emails, Cookies, etc)
    - How many total unique identifers do you have?
    - On average how many identifiers per audience?
