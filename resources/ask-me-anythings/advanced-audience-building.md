#customer
Can you explain how Narrative's platform can help us build advanced audiences from multiple data sources?

#responder
Absolutely. Our platform specializes in ingesting and managing identity data from dozens of sources. It allows you to build advanced audiences by querying datasets that are structured and normalized within our system. We ensure that data from various providers is standardized, making it easier for you to build precise audience segments without worrying about data format inconsistencies.

title: Data Normalization

#customer
How does data normalization work on your platform?

#responder
We have a data normalization process that automatically standardizes the data formats across all providers. This means when you're building an audience, you don't have to deal with the complexity of varying data formats. Our platform handles the conversion, ensuring you can focus on defining the audience criteria that matter most to your campaigns.

#customer
What kind of querying capabilities does your platform offer?

#responder
Our platform includes a powerful tool called the Narrative Query Language (NQL), an extension of SQL designed specifically for data collaboration and manipulation. It supports all standard SQL functionalities plus additional features for automated normalization and standardization. For ease of use, we also provide a query builder tool with a user-friendly interface for constructing queries without needing to write complex code.

title: Data Governance and Privacy
---
#customer
How do you handle data governance and privacy?

#responder
We take data governance seriously. Our platform uses access rules and query policies that define who can access which datasets and under what conditions. This ensures that data usage is in compliance with provider stipulations and privacy standards, providing a secure environment for data collaboration.

We also offer data privacy features that allow our customers to syndicate consumer opt outs and other privacy requests to our platform.  Once the data is in our platform, we ensure that it is respected and not used in any way that would violate the consumer's privacy rights including tombstoning data, notifying downstream collaboration partners of privacy requests, receiving and storing acknowledgements of privacy requests, and creating an end to end audit trail of the whole process.

#customer
Can you tell us more about the upcoming Narrative Anywhere feature?

#responder
Sure. Narrative Anywhere is an exciting development that allows our customers to host their data in their own cloud environments, like Snowflake. This means you can execute NQL queries directly in your cloud, leveraging our normalization and querying capabilities while maintaining full control over your data storage and processing. It's a step towards offering more flexibility and control to our users.
