#customer
Can you explain how the Crosswalk process works for secure data collaboration between partners?

#responder
Certainly. Our Crosswalk process is designed to enable secure data collaboration without directly sharing sensitive information between partners. Narrative matches raw PII (Personally Identifiable Information) such as hashed emails or mobile ad IDs to a Narrative ID. We then generate a unique Partner Narrative ID (PNID) for each partner. Each partner receives a PNID specifically hashed for them, allowing both parties to reference the same data indirectly. This facilitates secure data operations like matching and audience insights, ensuring privacy and compliance.

  How can we use Narrative IDs to collaborate with other Narrative partners
  
  #responder
  Using Crosswalks, you can securely build audience insights by pushing datasets with PNIDs to Narrative. We then facilitate the comparison of these datasets between partners without revealing the underlying data. For example, you can understand how many of your 'Tech Executives' audience were reached in a partner's campaign by using PNIDs for matching, all without disclosing the actual data. This way, you gain valuable insights while maintaining data privacy.

    How does the Crosswalk process ensure privacy and compliance?
    
    #responder
    Our Crosswalk process is built with privacy and compliance at its core. By using PNIDs instead of raw PII, we ensure that sensitive data is not shared between parties. This approach complies with stringent data protection regulations like GDPR and CCPA, as data is anonymized and encrypted. Additionally, our platform's governance features allow you to control and limit data access, further enhancing privacy and compliance.

      What if a partner we want to collaborate with is not yet on Narrative?
      
      #responder
      If your desired partner is not yet on Narrative, we facilitate their onboarding to ensure you can collaborate securely using Crosswalks. Our platform is designed for easy integration and scalability, allowing new partners to quickly join and participate in data collaboration activities. We support them through the process, ensuring that they can generate and use PNIDs for secure data operations.
