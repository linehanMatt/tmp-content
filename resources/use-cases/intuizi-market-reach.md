    Intuizi, a leader in providing anonymized first-party consented geo-location data, faced significant challenges in integrating and maximizing revenue from its extensive data assets. The integration process with multiple platforms was resource-intensive, involving legal and business complexities. Managing various revenue streams was cumbersome, and capitalizing on these streams required substantial engineering efforts. Additionally, establishing effective distribution channels was complex, limiting the potential for data monetization and market expansion.
