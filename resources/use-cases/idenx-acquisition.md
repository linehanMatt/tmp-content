    IdenX helps companies deliver exceptional business results by generating insights with leading AI technology and industry-specific knowledge. To deliver the best solutions to their customers, IdenX requires an extensive list of data points that spans multiple countries. In order to service a broad range of customers and their specific needs, IdenX needs to frequently acquire a variety of data, including demographics, location, language, device characteristics, and more.

    However, finding the range of quality data that they needed was proving tedious, expensive, and time-consuming when they tried going through traditional channels. Finding a centralized data acquisition solution was paramount in order for IdenX to be able to execute quickly and deliver the best results to their customers. That’s where Narrative’s data collaboration platform came in.
