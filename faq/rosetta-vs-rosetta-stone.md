Rosetta is Narrative's digital assistant, designed to help users navigate the platform and perform tasks.

Rosetta Stone is a patent pending technology Narrative created to act as a bridge between different data sources. It is a data transformation and normalization layer that allows users to work with data from different sources as if it were all from the same source. This is a key part of the Narrative platform and is used to make data collaboration easier.
