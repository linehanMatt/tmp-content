title: How much does Narrative cost
prompt: Describe Narrative's pricing model
---
Narrative's pricing model is based on the amount of data that you store, process, and use.  As a core functionality Narrative let's you store and process data as a data collaborator.  If you work with other collaborators there may be an additional price to access their data which they can set within the platform.

Narrative's pay-as-you-go pricing makes it easy to start using the platform with no up-front costs or commitments. We also offer deeply discounted usage rates when you commit to a set amount of usage over time.
