### Data selling pain points

1. Selling data directly requires you to either already have a relationship with a company that might want to buy your data, or to do research and find a potential buyer.
2. Selling your data to a data aggregator or another similar company that will sell data on your behalf means you don’t have nearly as much control over the transactions, and you may not get as favorable of a price.
3. Integrating with all your different buyers means spending time and money implementing and managing full time technical teams and solutions
4. Working with many different buyers means many different contracts and a lot of red lines

### Narrative’s Solutions

2. With yield management tools and a dedicated partner success team, you can make informed pricing decisions based on market conditions so you can always sell for the price you want.
