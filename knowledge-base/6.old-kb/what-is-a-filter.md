### Overview

Filters are a concept Narrative's Data Collaboration Platform that allows a buyer or seller to more precisely define their buying/selling strategy.  Filters limit the data that is eligible as part of a line item by specifying the allowable values of attributes that are part of a data record.

For buyers, filters are most often used to ensure that they are only buying records that will have value to them, effectively eliminating non-valuable data. 

For sellers, filters offer the ability to limit sell order line items to specific data, which is often used to create different commercial terms for subsets of their overall data.
