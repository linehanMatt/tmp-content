A subscription is the mechanism by which buyers set up their data acquisition strategies. Each order has an associated status that defines its expected output. The statuses are:

*   **Active** - The subscription has completed it's first delivery and is on stand by until the next delivery 
*   **Kickoff** - The subscription is preparing to deliver it's first delivery
*   **Completed** - The subscription has finished all deliveries and no further deliveries are scheduled. This status is usually only applicable to subscription's with a one time delivery cadence. 
*   **Deactivated** - the subscription has been cancelled and will not process any future transactions.  
*   **Pending** - The subscription has not been activated yet and will not process any data.
