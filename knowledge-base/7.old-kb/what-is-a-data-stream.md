### Overview

After [creating a dataset](https://kb.narrative.io/create-a-dataset), providers create data streams in [Seller Studio](https://app-dev.narrative.io/app/seller-studio) to make slices of their data available for purchase on their Data Shop. 

A **data stream** is a subset of a dataset that is packaged for sale. Create data streams to make subsets of data readily accessible to buyers in an e-commerce experience and to generate new customer leads.

### Data Stream Components

#### Product description

Provide a product **name**, **description**, **image**, **category**, and **tags** for your data stream.

Each data stream is housed at a unique product page URL or **slug** that can be crawled by Google Search to bring in new customers.

#### Data rules

Data rules consist of the **filters** defining what records are included in a data stream and the columns/fields that get delivered to data stream buyers.

**Filters**. When applying a filter to a field in a dataset, choose between:

*   **Include all values** (including records where the field is null)
*   **Include if present** (only take records where the field is not null)
*   **Custom** (apply more specific logic for what records are included in the data stream)

#### Offers

Make a data stream available for sale on the Data Streams Marketplace and/or your Data Shop. Have the flexibility to choose different prices for each channel, or remove all offers to take your data stream off the market.

#### Buyers and Private Data Streams

Data owners have full control over which companies are authorized to see and purchase a data stream.

Users who are not on the configured "Buyers" list will neither be able to see nor subscribe to a data stream. 

In order to restrict which buyers may access a data stream, you can use the "Buyers" section of the UI. Simply select whether you are "including" or "excluding" the companies that you select, and then select one or more companies.

  
Please note that if you want to offer a data stream to a specific buyer, you will need that buyer to register and create a user and a company.  If you want to mark a data stream in your data shop as "private", ensure that the buyers that will have access to the data stream have registered for your data shop. You can find the link for registration at: https://your-data-shop.com/register.
