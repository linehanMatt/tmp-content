# How to Share Your Data with an Advertiser Using The Trade Desk Connector

Sharing your data directly with advertisers using The Trade Desk Connector (aka First Party data) involves a straightforward process, allowing for efficient data delivery directly within the Narrative platform. This guide outlines the steps to configure the connector and send data to The Trade Desk, specifically for first-party deliveries. Before proceeding, ensure you are familiar with the distinction between sharing data to The Trade Desk (first-party data deliveries) and selling data in The Trade Desk's Data Marketplace (third-party data deliveries). You can read more about that in What is the difference between TTD 3rd party and 1st party.

For more information about The Trade Desk Connector generally, as well as supported datasets, see The Trade Desk Connector.

## Configuring the Connector

### Step 1: Installation

- **Option 1**: Install the Trade Desk Connector directly if you have the necessary permissions to install new apps on your platform.
- **Option 2**: Contact your Narrative representative to have the Trade Desk Connector installed for you.

### Step 2: Navigation

- Go to **Installed Apps** and select **TTD Connector**.

### Step 3: Obtain Advertiser ID and Secret

- To share data with an advertiser's account on The Trade Desk (first-party data delivery), you'll need The Trade Desk Advertiser ID and The Trade Desk Advertiser Secret Key for the advertiser you want to share your data with.

These identifiers can be obtained:

- From within the TTD UI (for retrieving your own Advertiser ID and Secret Key for first-party data delivery) in **Preferences** -> **First Party Data Credential**.
- Directly from your TTD Desk Rep (for retrieving your own Advertiser ID and Secret for first-party data delivery).
- From an advertiser directly (for sharing first-party data to an external advertiser, also known as second-party data delivery).

## Sending Data to The Connector

After completing the Trade Desk Connector setup, you can send data to the connector from various locations within the Narrative platform.

### Eligible Datasets

Note that in order to send data to The Trade Desk Connector, you must work with a Dataset that contains data that has been mapped to one of the Narrative Rosetta Stone Attributes that is supported by The Trade Desk Connector.

To read more about which data types are eligible for delivery to The Trade Desk, see Eligible Data Types.

If you select a Dataset that is _not_ mapped to one of the supported attributes, you will not see options for sending data to The Trade Desk.

### From My Data -> Dataset Details

1. Navigate to **My Data** and select a Dataset you wish to deliver to The Trade Desk.
2. Open the Dataset and go to the **Connections** tab.
3. Select The Trade Desk Connector and click **Add Connection**.
4. Choose the Advertiser(s) to whom the data should be delivered.
5. Click **Save**.

### From My Data

1. Go to **My Data** and select a Dataset you intend to deliver to The Trade Desk.
2. Click the **"..."** menu and select **Send to The Trade Desk**.
3. Choose the Advertiser(s) to whom the data should be delivered.
4. Click **Save**.

This guide should help you seamlessly share your first-party data with advertisers using The Trade Desk Connector. For any assistance or further information, do not hesitate to reach out to your Narrative representative.
