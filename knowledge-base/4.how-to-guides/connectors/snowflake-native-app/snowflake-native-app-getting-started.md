# Narrative Data Collaboration powered by Rosetta Stone Snowflake Native App

The **Narrative Data Collaboration powered by Rosetta Stone Snowflake Native App** offers a seamless integration for customers looking to enhance their data collaboration efforts. This powerful tool allows users to directly connect their Snowflake account to the Narrative platform, enabling the registration of one or more Snowflake databases as Datasets within Narrative.

- **Dataset Registration**: Register one or more of your Snowflake databases as datasets in Narrative, simplifying your data management and analysis processes.

This dedicated Data Plane ensures that any query executed against your dataset is performed within your Snowflake account, maintaining data security and integrity.
- **Connector Framework Access**: Users of the Snowflake native app can query their data and have it delivered downstream to valuable endpoints such as The Trade Desk Data Marketplace and Facebook Ad Manager. 

## Benefits
