### Overview

Device Alias provides details of a user's device, broken out into make, model, and operating system. Device Alias data is found in two data package types in the Narrative Platform - device characteristics & digital consumption data - and is found in both desktop & mobile environments.

This data is typically collected in a variety of scenarios, including through SDKs given user permission or Real-Time Bidding environments where this data is made accessible through programmatic auctions.

#### Examples

* iPhone X, iOS 13.3.1
* Pixel 3, Android 10.0
* Samsung Galaxy, Android 10.0

### Within Narrative

Device Alias is an optional data field in both Device Characteristics and Digital Consumption data types. This data can be effectively used to categorize user devices by make & model.

Users in the Narrative Platform can choose to include all available Device Alias data as part of the order or enter a specific example(s) of Device Alias to purchase only that type.
