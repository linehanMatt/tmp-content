### Overview

An **access rule** is a set of business rules define access to data within the Narrative platform.  Access defines who can run queries against data, what queries they can run, and how much if anything access costs.

If a dataset has no access rules, it cannot be queried.

Use access rules to:

* Control which records from a dataset can be purchased
* Set different price rates for different records from a dataset
* Set different rates for different buyers
* Make your data available only to specific buyers
* Limit the types of queries that can be run against your dataset
