A query is the mechanism by which collaborators set up their data strategies. Each query has an associated status that defines its expected output. The statuses are:

* **Active** - The query has completed it's first delivery and is on stand by until the next delivery
* **Kickoff** - The query is preparing to deliver it's first delivery
* **Completed** - The query has finished all deliveries and no further deliveries are scheduled. This status is usually only applicable to a query with a one time delivery cadence.
* **Deactivated** - the query has been cancelled and will not process any future transactions.
* **Pending** - The query has not been activated yet and will not process any data.
