### Overview

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a legal framework of guidelines around the collection and processing of personal data from consumers & individuals living the European Union (EU).

All companies who process EU citizen personal data must follow all new GDPR requirements to ensure they are handling consumer data properly under the new guidelines.

### Intentions of the Act

GDPR aims to create more protection of consumer data in the EU. The key requirements and protections in place are:

* Requiring the consent of subjects for data processing
* Anonymizing collected data to protect privacy (removing PII)
* Providing data breach notifications
* Facilitate safe transfer of data across borders

### Affects on the Data Industry

All companies that market goods or services to EU residents falls under this new regulation and must comply with all individual user requests that opt out of a company processing their personal data.

GDPR places more of the legal obligation on companies to properly process, handle, maintain and comply with all individual requests regarding use of their data.
