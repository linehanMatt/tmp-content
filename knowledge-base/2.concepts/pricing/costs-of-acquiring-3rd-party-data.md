### **Costs Overview:**

One of Data Studio's main use cases is a data acquisition. The product is designed to assist buyers in acquiring high-quality data in large quantities. In this article, weâ€™ll walk you through the costs and fees associated with activating a Data Studio one time Rosetta Stone query:

**Marketplace Data Costs:** the value to be paid by the buyer to the data provider for licensing their data.

**Marketplace Data Transaction Fee:** the value to be paid by the buyer to Narrative, charged as a percentage of the marketplace data costs.

**Platform Processing Costs:** the value to be paid by the buyer to Narrative for the compute resources required to run a query, charged as a dollars-per-byte fee.

Narrative uses data and cost forecasts to estimate a user's marketplace data costs, marketplace data transaction fee, and platform processing costs before activating an order. Note that there may also be transfer and storage costs associated with the order, depending on where the data is sent.

### Costs In Data Studio's Workflow

#### Costs Screen

Data Studio shows the monetary costs of activating a Rosetta Stone query once the forecast is finished. **The platform processing costs are in addition to the budget a user enters for their marketplace data costs and marketplace data transaction fee. The entered budget does not account for a user's processing costs**. For example, if a user adds a budget of $10,000, and the forecast returns with a $5,000 cost for processing, the price of activating the query (without any transfer or storage) is $15,000. Users who want to learn about lowering their query processing rate should contact Narrative.

A buyer's budget does take into account their marketplace data transaction fee, meaning if their budget is $100, and their transaction fee is 25%, Narrative will transact $80 of data (price before marketplace fees) and charge them $100 (1.25 \* $80 = $100).

If the cost forecast does not return before the user activates their subscription, no marketplace data cost or transaction fee are displayed. **There is no blocker preventing a user from creating a subscription without seeing the results of their forecast.**
