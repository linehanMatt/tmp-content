#### Licensing

Data sold through Narrative's data streaming platform normally includes a **30 day omni-use license**. This means a buyer licenses your data and has the ability to use it as they please for up to 30 days. As a data provider, you always have full control of your data through Direct Deals, which allows you to set up custom terms outside the of the standard licensing agreements.

#### Competitive CPM

Get in touch with a Partner Success team member to understand average marketplace pricing for the data types you are offering. With these insights you can choose to have a more competitive CPM or price your data at a premium. With Narrative, you have full control of how to price your data.
