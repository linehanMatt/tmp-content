**Storage** is based on the average gigabyte-hours per month of all Client Data stored in Client’s Narrative Account, including all object data and metadata. The average gigabyte-hours per month is calculated by taking an hourly snapshot of all Client Data and averaging this across the total hours in a given month.

**Processing** is based on the bytes processed per month in the course of Client’s usage of Narrative’s Products and Services, including but not limited to: transactions on the Narrative Marketplace or private transactions, forecasting, and order management and fulfillment. For all transactions, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing, Processing usage and related fees will be allocated to or incurred solely by: (a) the party that orders a given transaction; or (b) the Data Shop Client for transactions taking place within a Data Shop.

**Transfer (Ingress or Egress)**: Transfer is calculated as the volume of bytes transferred per month in or out of Client’s Narrative Account. Transfer to or from Client-owned locations within AWS Region “us-east-1” (US East, N. Virginia) will not incur Transfer Fees.

**Calculation of Usage:** Storage, Processing, and Transfer are calculated in binary gigabytes (GB), where 1 GB is 2³⁰ bytes. Similarly, 1 TB is 2⁴⁰ bytes, i.e. 1024 GBs.

The **Transaction Services Fee** (sometimes referred to as the "Data Transaction Fee") is a percentage of the Licensed Data Fees you transact, source or facilitate on the platform or via Narrative Services, including, without limitation, via any Connector App.

**Data Transaction**: Pay-as-you-go Processing and Storage Fees are waived for activity directly supporting data transactions where Client is offering data to be licensed or evaluated by a third-party, provided that the transaction (i) occurs or is expected by Narrative to occur within 90 days of such activity, and (ii) is subject to Transaction Services Fees. Narrative reserves the right to amend this waiver as necessary, limit activity to prevent possible harm to the platform, and apply Pay-as-you-go Fees to such activity if necessary, in which case Narrative will provide email notice at least 30 days in advance.

Narrative neither buys nor sells data. We provide software that powers commercial data transactions between companies.

Fees for the licensing of data ("**Licensed Data Fees**") and are set by and paid to Data Licensors through Narrative's software.
