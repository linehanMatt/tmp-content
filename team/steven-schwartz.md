Experienced disruptor with track record of driving sustainable growth for new and established businesses that challenge the status quo. I have led the transformation of legacy brands and deployed technology, AI and big data solutions to deliver results in healthtech, fintech, martech, SaaS, media, real-time information and more. The unique breadth of my experience across diverse industries with companies of all sizes provides me with a rich set of tools to draw upon to successfully confront any business challenge. I bring rigor, discipline, and humanity along with a strong mix of intellect and EQ that has helped me build high-performing teams resulting in successful outcomes. Integrity, teamwork, and humility are core to everything I do.
